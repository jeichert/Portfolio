A multi-family project located in Mott Haven, Bronx, this building features 41 dwelling units, and amenities over 33,868 SF. The project was built in an accelerated timeline project in which the client tasked us with devising plans for the upper floors while the foundation was under construction. The upper floor and accessible rooftop featured amenity space for the tenants including a gym, and lounge.
